Historically Java has been one of the most popular languages to create cross-platform desktop applications. Even as web technologies became increasingly prevalent in UI programming, writing computationally intensive applications like emulators in the web browser was considered infeasible due to both performance requirements and shortcomings of JavaScript as a language for big software projects.
In recent years WebAssembly has emerged as an alternative to JavaScript for the computationally intensive parts of web applications, making the web browser a viable target for heavy cross platform applications.

In this thesis the two Emulators from the popular Nand to Tetris course were rewritten in Rust and then compiled to WebAssembly. The results shows that it is not only possible to port resource heavy applications like emulators into the web browser, but it is also reasonable and meaningful. WebAssembly offers a real alternative to classic cross-platform desktop applications.

Furthermore the resulting application provides an improved user experience to course participants for the Nand to Tetris course by addressing both performance and usability issues in the original emulator implementation.
