\section{Implementation}

\subsection{General approach}
\subsubsection{Test driven development of the VM without an UI}
\begin{itemize}
  \item first implement bytecode parser, because it can be used in VM Tests
  \item basic VM features (everything except for function, call, return)
  \item testing with unit tests (Translations of VME.tst tests)
  \item rest of the VM instructions
  \item stdlib only as vm bytecode
\end{itemize}
