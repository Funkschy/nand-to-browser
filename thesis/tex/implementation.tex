\subsection{General approach}
\subsubsection{Test driven development of the VM without an UI}
\begin{itemize}
  \item first implement bytecode parser, because it can be used in VM Tests
  \item basic VM features (everything except for function, call, return)
  \item testing with unit tests (Translations of VME.tst tests)
  \item rest of the VM instructions
  \item stdlib only as vm bytecode
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Architectural overview}
The general architecture of the application is outlined in \cref{fig:arch}.
There are three possible entry points for the application, which are listed in the interfaces section of the figure.

\subsection{VM development in Rust}
\subsection{Parser development in Rust}
\subsection{The test-script workflow}
\subsection{The native standard library protocol}
\subsection{Using conditional compilation in Rust}
